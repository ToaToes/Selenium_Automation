## 1. API Testing: 
Request Creation: Postman allows testers to create various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) easily. You can set headers, query parameters, and request bodies, making it suitable for testing different API endpoints.
## 2. Automated Testing with Collections:
Test Scripts: You can write test scripts in JavaScript to validate responses, check status codes, and assert that returned data meets specific criteria.
Collections: Group related requests into collections. This makes it easier to organize tests and run them as a suite.
## 3. Environment Management:
Variables: Postman supports environment variables, which allow you to store and reuse values (like base URLs, authentication tokens, etc.) across different requests. This is useful for switching between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
## 4. Automation with Newman:
Command-Line Tool: Newman is Postmanâ€™s command-line tool that allows you to run Postman collections from the terminal. This enables integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing during build and deployment processes.
## 5. Mock Servers:
Postman can simulate API endpoints using mock servers, allowing you to test your application even when the backend is not fully developed or available.
## 6. Documentation:
Postman can automatically generate API documentation from collections, helping teams maintain up-to-date API specs and making it easier for new developers to understand the API.
## 7. Collaboration:
Team Workspaces: Postman provides features for collaboration, allowing team members to share collections, environments, and test results easily.
## 8. Monitoring:
Postman also offers monitoring features to run collections at scheduled intervals, enabling you to track API performance and uptime.

**Example Use Case**
Creating a Test: You create a POST request to register a user and write test scripts to verify that the response status is 201 and that the response body contains the user ID.

Running Collections: You run a collection of API tests for your application using Newman in your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that any changes to the codebase do not break existing API functionality.
