## 1. Build Automation
Purpose: Maven automates the process of compiling code, packaging it into JAR or WAR files, and managing dependencies.
Usage: You can define your build lifecycle in a pom.xml file, specifying how the project should be built, including phases like compilation, testing, and packaging.
## 2. Dependency Management
Purpose: Maven simplifies the management of external libraries and dependencies.
Usage: You can declare dependencies in the pom.xml file, and Maven will automatically download and include the necessary libraries, ensuring compatibility and version control.
## 3. Testing Framework Integration
Purpose: Maven integrates easily with various testing frameworks (like JUnit, TestNG).
Usage: You can configure your project to run tests automatically as part of the build process, ensuring that your code is always tested after changes.
## 4. Plugin Support
Purpose: Maven has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality.
Usage: You can use plugins for tasks such as code analysis, reporting, documentation generation, and integration with CI/CD tools.
## 5. Continuous Integration
Purpose: Maven is often used in CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and testing processes.
Usage: Tools like Jenkins can trigger Maven builds automatically whenever code is committed, running tests and generating reports.
## 6. Project Structure and Standards
Purpose: Maven encourages a standard directory structure for projects, which can improve organization and collaboration.
Usage: Following conventions can make it easier for new developers to understand the project layout.
